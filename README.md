# Hang Hombre

## Hangman to practice and reinforce Spanish vocabulary

**Preliminary vocabulary**
Initially, this will consist of an array of 10 words that are all verbs.  
Over time, this array library should expand.  10 is for working purposes.

When a random word is loaded, the player should have six opportunities to fill in the underlines
by pressing (i.e. clicking) on a letter in the table to the right.

Should the player guess all letters correctly before the hombre is hanged completely,  
a message will pop up across the screen congratulating the player for a job well done.  Eventually,
random messages should come up saying that it is a win or a loss.
