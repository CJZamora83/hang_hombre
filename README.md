# ¡Salvanos!

## ¡Salvanos! is a fun game that helps those learning a foreign language -  
##in this particular case, Spanish - to reinforce their recall of vocabulary.

**Preliminary vocabulary**
Initially, this consisted of an array of 10 words that are all verbs.  
However, given that Spanish verbs fall within 3 conjugation patterns and have 3 similar forms in their infinitive form, I decided to increase the word count in the word array to 100 words.  All 100 words are varying in form, subject/topic, and have little to no relation to eachother.  This helps to mitigate any chances of the player being able to quickly decipher the word and pose to them the most important part of learning, a challenge to recall something either previously learned or the opportunity to learn a new word which they have not yet seen.

Upon clicking the Start button, a count down of 10 seconds begins on the right of the screen and, ultimately, this should simulate the impending danger of a bomb that will surely explode the Player and his fellow soldiers unless the Codebreaker - player - can decipher the word in time and save everyone from "the bomb".
